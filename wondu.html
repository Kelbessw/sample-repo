      A fork in GitHub is a copy of a repository that allows you to make changes
      to the original project without affecting the original repository. This
      makes it easy for developers to make contributions and improvements to
      open-source projects, as well as for individuals to use someone else's
      code as a starting point for their own projects. To create a fork, you
      simply click the "Fork" button on the repository page, and a new copy of
      the repository will be created in your GitHub account. You can then make
      changes to your fork, push those changes to your fork on GitHub, and even
      create a pull request to ask the original repository owner to merge your
      changes back into the original project.
